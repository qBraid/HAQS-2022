2. At the top of this `README` in the forked repo, click the **Launch on qBraid** button to clone this repository and launch qBraid Lab.
3. Open terminal (first icon in the **Other** column in Launcher) and `cd` into the HAQS repo. Set the repo's remote origin using the git clone url you copied in Step 1, and then create a new branch for your team:
```bash
cd HAQS-2022
git remote set-url origin <url>
git branch <team_name>
git checkout <team_name>
```
4. Use the environment manager (**ENVS** tab in the right sidebar) to [install environment](https://qbraid-qbraid.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/lab/environments.html#install-environment) "HAQS 2022". The installation should take ~2 min.
3. Once the installation is complete, click **Activate** to [add a new ipykernel](https://qbraid-qbraid.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/lab/kernels.html#add-remove-kernels) for "HAQS 2022".
5. From the **FILES** tab in the left sidebar, double-click on the `HAQS-2022` directory.
6. Open and follow instructions in [`verify_setup.ipynb`](verify_setup.ipynb) to verify your "HAQS 2022" environment setup.
7. You are now ready to begin hacking! Work with your team to complete either of the challenges listed above.

To submit your hack, create a pull request from your team's named branch (created during Step 4 above) following challenge submission instructions.
